# Gene-Clustering
It is well-known that in the human genome there exist large clusters of genes which are separated by vast geneless regions. There is evidence of a similar phenomenon in large plant genomes, such as the recently seqenced *Aegilops tauschii*. One difference, however, is that in this genome, the clusters seem to be on a very small scale (on the order of 2-3 genes per cluster in a sea of many thousands of genes). The aim of this project is to discover so-called gene islands, or *insulae* without choosing cluster parameters (e.g. number of clusters, genes per cluster) a priori.
